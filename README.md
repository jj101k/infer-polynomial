# InferPolynomial

## Overview

This is a tool to take some results which either were generated by a polynomial
or can be helpfully expressed that way and in some sense estimate what that
polynomial would be. Note that while the resultant value will accurately produce
the same results, it might not precisely match any original value.

## Usage

```js
import { InferPolynomial } from "infer-polynomial"

// This means that F(1) => 1 and F(2) => 3
const myValues = {1: 1, 2: 3}
InferPolynomial.infer(myValues) // You'll get [-1, 2] on this.
```
